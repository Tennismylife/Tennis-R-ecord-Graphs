# Tennis-R-ecord-Graphs

A tools collection to plot graphs with tennis records.

An essential component of our work is to create graphs that show tennis records.

The tabular part is essential, and is the basis of all the work, but seeing the data on graphs has a completely different flavor.

Over the years, thousands of graphs have been published, attributable to a dozen (if not hundreds) of different categories. In this repository we will report some of these cases, the most important which, if properly extended, cover a large chunk of all possible sets. 

# AgeOfNRecord

The first example is a histogram that graphs a set ordered by age of those who have achieved a certain achievement. In the specific case there is a famous example, namely that of the youngest winners of an ATP tournament

# OverAgedInATournament

This example plots a histogram that counts how many players in a given tournament are older than a certain threshold (year by year)

# PieChart

# Timespan3D

When we are dealing with 3 parameters to plot it is useful to use a 3D histogram. In this case, the timespans between the 1st and the last title, final and semifinals in the Slams of Federer, Connors and Nadal are plotted
